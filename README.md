# Association for Pathology Informatics R Workshop

## Welcome!

This introductory R workshop aims to teach participants with little or no programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed squarely at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and publication-quality data visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data.

## Before you arrive

### Get Ready...

For the best experience, please have the following ready before the workshop begins:

- Preferably two monitors (or two laptops), one for the Zoom conference software, and one in which you will work. 
- Install the latest version of [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download).
- Install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as some [older browsers](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/227449447-Supported-browsers-for-RStudio-Connect) may not be compatible with the RStudio application).
- We may need to use RStudio Cloud as a backup training environment. Please sign up for a free account [here](https://rstudio.cloud/).

### Get Set...

- User specific usernames and passwords will be emailed to you shortly before the workshop. Please have these available. 
- Calendar invites with Zoom details will be sent prior to the workshop.
- Join the pre-course technology/AV check sessions tentatively schedule for 7/14/2021 at 1pm ET- details are in the pre-course email.
- Please complete the following survey so we can better understand your R experience and what you want out of the course: [API R Workshop Participant Survey](https://forms.gle/Xe3U71ZBZRmrP2E87).

### Go!

The workshop is scheduled to begin on 7/15 at 1 pm ET. Please make every effort to log into the Zoom conference 10 - 15 minutes early to allow time to get settled, ensure your computer audio and video is set up, and get RStudio cloud up and running.

## Accessing/interacting with the course content

1. Course content will be pre-loaded in the RStudio instance and is available for download there as a .zip file.
2. The content is available at [our course github page](https://github.com/amromeo/api_r2021) and can be downloaded from there as well.

## A note on the mechanics and etiquette of the virtual workshop
* Please do not use anyone else's username.
* Please refrain from screen grabbing other user's information, recording the workshop, or otherwise disrupting the flow of the Zoom Meeting.
* Please exercise appropriate Zoom etiquette by muting your microphone during sessions. Breakout sessions will be used for those who request additional one-one-one assistance during exercises.

## Installing RStudio onto your own computer

We will be utilizing our cloud based RStudio instance in the workshop. However, _in the long term_, you will need R and RStudio installed **on your own computer** in order to work on private data. You can find step by step instructions for installing these on macOS ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g)) or Windows ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)).


## Acknowledgments

All of the course instructors have previous experience implementing and executing R workshops at a variety of venues. The workshop we are presenting for the API community is in many ways a product of these past experiences. The workshop also integrates content, best practices, and lessons from a variety of educators in the R community. We would like to specifically acknowledge: 

- [MSACL Data Science 201](https://github.com/pcmathias/MSACL-intermediate-R-course), a course produced by Patrick Mathias and several collaborators, presented at the Mass Spectrometry: Applications to the Clinical Lab meeting.
